We will also allow for our server to request these pages.\n","\n","**Current Problem**: Currently we have html code embedded into functions in our views.py file. While this is great for initial testing of our server, the html code we are looking to implement will be much more robust. Additionally the way we have currently implimented our HTML means that we must repeat code for each function.   \n","\n","**Solution**: \n","Hence we will look to create a new folder containing all pages the user will view and interact with.
