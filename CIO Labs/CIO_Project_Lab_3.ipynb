        "**Objective:** In this lab we will be looking to create a base HTML template which will be inherited by all child HTML pages. We will also be using bootstrap as quick way to style our HTML pages. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Current problem:** As it stands our HTML pages have a lot of repeated code. If we look at them currently, the only code which they differ on is the title. So why is this a problem? If we wanted to change or add a piece of code which will apply to all HTML pages we will have to go to all our HTML pages one by one and do so. This may not be a problem now when we only have 2 pages; but what about when we have 10 or 20? This becomes a huge maintenance issue and could potentially cause a lot of errors down the line. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:** To fix the problem of repeated code we can create one base HTML file which will house the code that is not unique to the each HTML page. This HTML file will be inherited to all other files allowing for clean uniformity and for easy updates and changes. We will also be using Bootstrap for quick styling of our pages. "
